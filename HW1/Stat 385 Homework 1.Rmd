## Exercise 1: Where am I?
1. The instructor for this class is James Balamuta.
2. The office is 122 Illin Hall. The office hours are Monday and Tuesday from 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM CDT.
3. The right way is: [STAT 385] Specific group project question. And this must be sent from an @illinois.edu account.
4. The time for the class is 3:00 PM - 4:50 PM, on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. The location is Sieble 1105.
5. There are 2 exams. The mid-term exam is on July 6th. And the final exam is on August 3rd.
6. There are four phases: Proposal, Progress Update, Project Presentation, Final Project Report. Each phase is worth 43.75 points. The student's grade is based on the contribution and individual peer evaluations.


## Exercise 2: To github and Beyond
1. Github profile : https://github.com/Teng-Li3
2. Repository: https://github.com/Teng-Li3/helloworld3

## Exercise 4:
3. Absolute path: /master/helloworld3/HW1/analysis. Relative path: ./analysis.
4. 
   + If we only use $RANDOM, we have 26926, 8097, and 31950. Using $((1+ RANDOM % 10)), we have the number 4, which is in the range of 1-10. 
   + Both command will generate random numbers.
5. 
  + 5. First 5 numbers: 10,3,8,4,5.  Last 5 numbers: 6,2,5,5,7. They are all in the range 1-10. However, they are different random numbers.
  + 7. 
       + Section 1:Define variables for later loop.
       + Section 2: A while loop that calculate the summation of all the numbers in a line (sum) and how many numbers we have (count). 
       + Section 3: If statement: if the procudure is right, then calculate the mean of these numbers. (mu=sum/count) If the procedure is not right, say :Please supply a file with more than 1 line of numerical input.
       + Mean of continuous uniform distribution is $$(\frac{a+b}{2})$$, where a,b are the minimum and maximum limits of the sample. The results is fixed. However, in our case, if we have different numbers (count), we might have different results.
       + Use cd/../  to change to my home directory.



## Exercise 5 part(1)
```{r}
a = rep(0,25)                        # Define a
  
b1 = seq(1,25,by=1 ) 
b =  b1^2                            # Define b

d=seq(0,1,length.out=25)             # Define d

e1=seq(1,25)
e=log(e1)                            # Define e

set.seed(25) 
y  = 2 * a + b / 4 + 8 * d - 3 * e + rnorm(25, 0 , 1)          # Define y
```

## Exercise 5 part(2) : define y with seed.
```{r}
a = rep(42,25)                       # Define a

b1 = seq(1,25,by=1 )
b =  b1^2                            # Define b

d=seq(0,1,length.out=25)             # Define d

e1=seq(1,25)
e=log(e1)                            # Define e

set.seed(25)                         # With seed
y  = 2 * a + b / 4 + 8 * d - 3 * e + rnorm(25, 0 , 1)                # Define y
```

## Exercise 5 part(3): define y without seed.
```{r}
a = rep(42,25)                       # Define a

b1 = seq(1,25,by=1 )
b =  b1^2                            # Define b

d=seq(0,1,length.out=25)             # Define d

e1=seq(1,25)
e=log(e1)                            # Define e

y  = 2 * a + b / 4 + 8 * d - 3 * e + rnorm(25, 0 , 1)                # Define y        
```

The difference:

1. [1]  84.03817  82.21230  82.46752  85.16265  85.25489  88.84585  94.14631  96.60630

[25] 237.85666

3. All the numbers are different. However, the differences are very small.



## Exercise 5 part(4)
```{r}
f =letters

g= c(f,b)
```
Numbers in b are now in "". For example, we have "1".


## Exercise 5 part (5)
```{r}
m = y>10                       # Create logical vetor

sum(y>10)                      # Number of elements greater than 10
```


## Exercise 6 
```{r}
# Problem 1
for (n in 1:100)
{
  cat( (-1)^(2*n+1))
}

# Problem 2
for (n in 1:100)
{
  cat( (-1)^(2*n))
}

```

Compute the summation $$\sum_{n=2}^{100} cos(n*pi)/sqrt(n)$$
```{r}
i=0
for (n in 2:100)
{
  new_num=cos(n*pi) /(sqrt(n))
  i=i+new_num
}
cat(new_num)
```

Compute the summation $$\sum_{n=2}^{100} (\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n})$$
```{r}
i=0
for (n in 2:100)
{
  new_num=((-1)^(n+1))/(n)
  i=i+new_num
}
cat(new_num)
```

Compute the summation $$\sum_{n=1}^{100} (\frac{(-1)^{2n}n}{n^2+5})$$
```{r}
i=0
for (n in 1:100)
{
  new_num=(((-1)^(2*n))*n)/(2*n+5)
  i=i+new_num
}
cat(new_num)
```




## Exercise 7
```{r}
for (i in 1:100)
{
  if (i %% 3 == 0 || i %% 5 == 0){
    cat('FizzBuzz')
  } 
  
  else if (i %% 3 == 0 ) {
    cat('Fizz')
  } 
  
  else if (i %% 5 == 0 ) {
    cat('Buzz')
  } 
  
  else {
    cat(i)
  }
    
}
```
